# **Pymaceuticals**

The Pymaceuticals challenge revolved around the analysis of lab mice, which underwent different types of cancer treatments and specifically focuses on the drug Capomulin and how it compares to other treatments. 

--------------------------------------------

### **The following analysis was done based on the results:**
- When looking at the top four drug regimes, which include treatments with Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin; Capomulin and Ramicane regimes seem to result in lower final tumor volumes than treatments with Infubinol and Ceftamin.
- However, as the bar charts show, more treatments were conducted with Capomulin and Ramicane than with any other drugs, which may produce more reliable results. This does not mean that these two drugs are better or worse than the others but should still be considered when drawing final conclusions. 
- When looking back at the top four regimes, there was only one outlier amongst all of them, which is a promising aspect towards reliable results.
- Capomulin specifically starts reducing tumor volume about 20 days after treatment begin.
- The average tumor volume and weight of the mice are strongly positively correlated under the Capomulin regime.
